## ⚪ ️ 3.10 Expose the tests as a live collaborative document

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Besides increasing app reliability, tests bring another attractive opportunity to the table - serve as live app documentation. Since tests inherently speak at a less-technical and product/UX language, using the right tools they can serve as a communication artifact that greatly aligns all the peers - developers and their customers. For example, some frameworks allow expressing the flow and expectations (i.e. tests plan) using a human-readable language so any stakeholder, including product managers, can read, approve and collaborate on the tests which just became the live requirements document. This technique is also being referred to as 'acceptance test' as it allows the customer to define his acceptance criteria in plain language. This is [BDD (behavior-driven testing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) at its purest form. One of the popular frameworks that enable this is [Cucumber which has a JavaScript flavor](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), see example below. Another similar yet different opportunity, [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/), allows exposing UI components as a graphic catalog where one can walk through the various states of each component (e.g. render a grid w/o filters, render that grid with multiple rows or with none, etc), see how it looks like, and how to trigger that state - this can appeal also to product folks but mostly serves as live doc for developers who consume those components.

❌ **Otherwise:** After investing top resources on testing, it's just a pity not to leverage this investment and win great value
