## ⚪ ️ 3.4 Don't sleep, use frameworks built-in support for async events. Also try to speed things up

:white_check_mark: **Do:** In many cases, the unit under test completion time is just unknown (e.g. animation suspends element appearance) - in that case, avoid sleeping (e.g. setTimeOut) and prefer more deterministic methods that most platforms provide. Some libraries allows awaiting on operations (e.g. [Cypress cy.request('url')](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Unnecessary-Waiting)), other provide API for waiting like [@testing-library/dom method wait(expect(element))](https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-disappearance). Sometimes a more elegant way is to stub the slow resource, like API for example, and then once the response moment becomes deterministic the component can be explicitly re-rendered. When depending upon some external component that sleeps, it might turn useful to [hurry-up the clock](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/timer-mocks). Sleeping is a pattern to avoid because it forces your test to be slow or risky (when waiting for a too short period). Whenever sleeping and polling is inevitable and there's no support from the testing framework, some npm libraries like [wait-for-expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-for-expect) can help with a semi-deterministic solution
<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** When sleeping for a long time, tests will be an order of magnitude slower. When trying to sleep for small numbers, test will fail when the unit under test didn't respond in a timely fashion. So it boils down to a trade-off between flakiness and bad performance

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: E2E API that resolves only when the async operations is done (Cypress)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/🔧%20Example%20using%20React%20Testing%20Library-blue.svg "Examples with react-testing-library")

```javascript
// using Cypress
cy.get("#show-products").click(); // navigate
cy.wait("@products"); // wait for route to appear
// this line will get executed only when the route is ready
```

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Testing library that waits for DOM elements

```javascript
// @testing-library/dom
test("movie title appears", async () => {
  // element is initially not present...

  // wait for appearance
  await wait(() => {
    expect(getByText("the lion king")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  // wait for appearance and return the element
  const movie = await waitForElement(() => getByText("the lion king"));
});
```

### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: custom sleep code

```javascript
test("movie title appears", async () => {
  // element is initially not present...

  // custom wait logic (caution: simplistic, no timeout)
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    const found = getByText("the lion king");
    if (found) {
      clearInterval(interval);
      expect(getByText("the lion king")).toBeInTheDocument();
    }
  }, 100);

  // wait for appearance and return the element
  const movie = await waitForElement(() => getByText("the lion king"));
});
```
