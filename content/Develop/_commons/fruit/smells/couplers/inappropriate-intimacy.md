# Inappropriate Intimacy

### Signs and Symptoms

One class uses the internal fields and methods of another class.<figure class="image">

### Reasons for the Problem

Keep a close eye on classes that spend too much time together. Good classes should know as little about each other as possible. Such classes are easier to maintain and reuse.

### Treatment
- The simplest solution is to use [[move-method|Move Method]] and [[move-field|Move Field]] to move parts of one class to the class in which those parts are used. But this works only if the first class truly doesn't need these parts.

- Another solution is to use [[extract-class|Extract Class]] and [[hide-delegate|Hide Delegate]] on the class to make the code relations "official".- If the classes are mutually interdependent, you should use [[change-bidirectional-association-to-unidirectional|Change Bidirectional Association To Unidirectional]]
- If this "intimacy" is between a subclass and the superclass, consider [Replace Delegation with Inheritance](/replace-delegation-with-inheritance).
