# Middle Man
### Signs and Symptoms

If a class performs only one action, delegating work to another class why does it exist at all?<figure class="image">

### Reasons for the Problem

This smell can be the result of overzealous elimination of [[Develop/_commons/fruit/smells/couplers/message-chains|Message Chains]]. In other cases, it can be the result of the useful work of a class being gradually moved to other classes. The class remains as an empty shell that doesn't do anything other than delegate.

### Treatment
- If most of a method's classes delegate to another class, [[remove-middle-man|Remove Middle Man]] is in order.

### Payoff- Less bulky code.<figure class="image">

### When to Ignore

Don't delete middle man that have been created for a reason:
- A middle man may have been added to avoid interclass dependencies.
- Some design patterns create middle man on purpose (such as [[Develop/_commons/tree/Design Patterns/catalog/structural/proxy|Proxy]] or [[Develop/_commons/tree/Design Patterns/catalog/structural/decorator|Decorator]]).
