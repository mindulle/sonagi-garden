# Shotgun Surgery

> *Shotgun Surgery* resembles [[Develop/_commons/fruit/smells/change-preventers/divergent-change|Divergent Change]] but is actually the opposite smell. *Divergent Change* is when many changes are made to a single class. *Shotgun Surgery* refers to when a single change is made to multiple classes simultaneously.

### Signs and Symptoms

Making any modifications requires that you make many small changes to many different classes.<figure class="image">

### Reasons for the Problem
A single responsibility has been split up among a large number of classes. This can happen after overzealous application of [Divergent Change](/smells/divergent-change).<figure class="image">

### Treatment

- Use [[move-method|Move Method]] and [[move-field|Move Field]] to move existing class behaviors into a single class. If there's no class appropriate for this, create a new one.- If moving code to the same class leaves the original classes almost empty, try to get rid of these now-redundant classes via [[inline-class|Inline Class]].
