# Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies

### Signs and Symptoms

Whenever you create a subclass for a class, you find yourself needing to create a subclass for another class.<figure class="image">

### Reasons for the Problem

All was well as long as the hierarchy stayed small. But with new classes being added, making changes has become harder and harder.

### Treatment

- You may de-duplicate parallel class hierarchies in two steps. First, make instances of one hierarchy refer to instances of another hierarchy. Then, remove the hierarchy in the referred class, by using [[move-method|Move Method]] and [[move-field|Move Field]].

### Payoff
- Reduces code duplication.- Can improve organization of code.

### When to Ignore
- Sometimes having parallel class hierarchies is just a way to avoid even bigger mess with program architecture. If you find that your attempts to de-duplicate hierarchies produce even uglier code, just step out, revert all of your changes and get used to that code.
