# Speculative Generality

### Signs and Symptoms

There's an unused class, method, field or parameter.

### Reasons for the Problem
Sometimes code is created "just in case" to support anticipated future features that never get implemented. As a result, code becomes hard to understand and support.

### Treatment

- For removing unused abstract classes, try [[collapse-hierarchy|Collapse Hierarchy]].
  
- Unnecessary delegation of functionality to another class can be eliminated via [[inline-class|Inline Class]].
  
- Unused methods? Use [[inline-method|Inline Method]] to get rid of them.
  
- Methods with unused parameters should be given a look with the help of [[remove-parameter|Remove Parameter]].
  
- Unused fields can be simply deleted.

### Payoff
- Slimmer code.
- Easier support.
  
### When to Ignore

- If you're working on a framework, it's eminently reasonable to create functionality not used in the framework itself, as long as the functionality is needed by the frameworks's users.
  
- Before deleting elements, make sure that they aren't used in unit tests. This happens if tests need a way to get certain internal information from a class or perform special testing-related actions.
