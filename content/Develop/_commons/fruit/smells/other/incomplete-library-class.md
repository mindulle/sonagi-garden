# Incomplete Library Class

### Signs and Symptoms
Sooner or later, [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) stop meeting user needs. The only solution to the problem---changing the library---is often impossible since the library is read-only.

### Reasons for the Problem
The author of the library hasn't provided the features you need or has refused to implement them.

### Treatment
- To introduce a few methods to a library class, use [Introduce     Foreign Method](/introduce-foreign-method).
- For big changes in a class library, use [Introduce Local Extension](/introduce-local-extension).

### Payoff
- Reduces code duplication (instead of creating your own library from scratch, you can still piggy-back off an existing one).

### When to Ignore
- Extending a library can generate additional work if the changes to the library involve changes in code.
