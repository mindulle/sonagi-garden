# Remove Setting Method

### Problem

The value of a field should be set only when it's created, and not
change at any time after that.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Customer{
    SetImmutableValue()
  }
```

### Solution

So remove methods that set the field's value.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Customer
```

### Why Refactor

You want to prevent any changes to the value of a field.

### How to Refactor

1. The value of a field should be changeable only in the constructor. If the constructor doesn't contain a parameter for setting the value, add one.

2. Find all setter calls.
    - If a setter call is located right after a call for the constructor of the current class, move its argument to the constructor call and remove the setter.

    - Replace setter calls in the constructor with direct access to the field.

3. Delete the setter.
