# Introduce Null Object

### Problem

Since some methods return `null` instead of real objects, you have many checks for `null` in your code.

```ts
if (customer == null) {
  plan = BillingPlan.basic();
}
else {
  plan = customer.getPlan();
}
```

### Solution

Instead of `null`, return a null object that exhibits the default
behavior.

```ts
class NullCustomer extends Customer {
  isNull(): boolean {
    return true;
  }
  getPlan(): Plan {
    return new NullPlan();
  }
  // Some other NULL functionality.
}

// Replace null values with Null-object.
let customer = (order.customer != null) ?
  order.customer : new NullCustomer();

// Use Null-object as if it's normal subclass.
plan = customer.getPlan();
```

### Why Refactor

Dozens of checks for `null` make your code longer and uglier.

### Drawbacks

- The price of getting rid of conditionals is creating yet another new class.

### How to Refactor

1. From the class in question, create a subclass that will perform the role of null object.

2. In both classes, create the method `isNull()`, which will return `true` for a null object and `false` for a real class.

3. Find all places where the code may return `null` instead of a real object. Change the code so that it returns a null object.

4. Find all places where the variables of the real class are compared with `null`. Replace these checks with a call for `isNull()`.

5. 
   - If methods of the original class are run in these conditionals when a value doesn't equal `null`, redefine these methods in the null class and insert the code from the `else` part of the condition there. Then you can delete the entire conditional and differing behavior will be implemented via polymorphism.
     
   - If things aren't so simple and the methods can't be redefined, see if you can simply extract the operators that were supposed to be performed in the case of a `null` value to new methods of the null object. Call these methods instead of the old code in `else` as the operations by default.
