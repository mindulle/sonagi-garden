# Remove Middle Man

### Problem

A class has too many methods that simply delegate to other objects.

```mermaid

classDiagram

  direction TB

  class Client

  class Person {

    getManager()

  }

  class Department

  Client ..> Person

  Person ..> Department

```

### Solution

Delete these methods and force the client to call the end methods directly.

```mermaid

classDiagram

  class Client

  class Person {

    getDepartment()

  }

  class Department {

    getManager()

  }

  

  Client ..> Person

  Client ..> Department

  Person <..> Department

```

### Why Refactor

To describe this technique, we'll use the terms from [[hide-delegate|Hide Delegate]], which are:

- *Server* is the object to which the client has direct access.
- *Delegate* is the end object that contains the functionality needed by the client.

There are two types of problems:

1. The *server-class* doesn't do anything itself and simply creates needless complexity. In this case, give thought to whether this class is needed at all.

2. Every time a new feature is added to the *delegate*, you need to create a delegating method for it in the *server-class*. If a lot of changes are made, this will be rather tiresome.

### How to Refactor

1. Create a getter for accessing the *delegate-class* object from the *server-class* object.

2. Replace calls to delegating methods in the *server-class* with direct calls for methods in the *delegate-class*.
