## Code Smells

- What? How can code \"smell\"??\
- Well it doesn\'t have a nose\... but it definitely can stink!

### [Bloaters](/refactoring/smells/bloaters)


Bloaters are code, methods and classes that have increased to such
gargantuan proportions that they are hard to work with. Usually these
smells do not crop up right away, rather they accumulate over time as
the program evolves (and especially when nobody makes an effort to
eradicate them).

### [Object-Orientation Abusers](/refactoring/smells/oo-abusers) {#oo-abusers}


All these smells are incomplete or incorrect application of
object-oriented programming principles.

srcset="/images/refactoring/content/catalog/change-preventers-2x.png?id=94d4444b1a3414ac3704f4ab53062f08 2x"}



### [Change Preventers](/refactoring/smells/change-preventers)


These smells mean that if you need to change something in one place in
your code, you have to make many changes in other places too. Program
development becomes much more complicated and expensive as a result.

### [Dispensables](/refactoring/smells/dispensables)


A dispensable is something pointless and unneeded whose absence would
make the code cleaner, more efficient and easier to understand.

### [Couplers](/refactoring/smells/couplers)


All the smells in this group contribute to excessive coupling between
classes or show what happens if coupling is replaced by excessive
delegation.

## Refactoring Techniques {#refactoring .h1}




![](/images/refactoring/content/catalog/composing-methods.png?id=953854e802753495812cb9b2686765f7){width="160"
height="280"
srcset="/images/refactoring/content/catalog/composing-methods-2x.png?id=75620eee35ec53ff9e21955cba2c70c9 2x"}



### [Composing Methods](/refactoring/techniques/composing-methods)


Much of refactoring is devoted to correctly composing methods. In most
cases, excessively long methods are the root of all evil. The vagaries
of code inside these methods conceal the execution logic and make the
method extremely hard to understand---and even harder to change.

The refactoring techniques in this group streamline methods, remove code
duplication, and pave the way for future improvements.



-   [Extract Method](/extract-method)
-   [Inline Method](/inline-method)
-   [Extract Variable](/extract-variable)
-   [Inline Temp](/inline-temp)

-   [Replace Temp with Query](/replace-temp-with-query)
-   [Split Temporary Variable](/split-temporary-variable)

    Parameters](/remove-assignments-to-parameters)

```{=html}

-   [Replace Method with Method
    Object](/replace-method-with-method-object)
-   [Substitute Algorithm](/substitute-algorithm)

srcset="/images/refactoring/content/catalog/moving-features-between-objects-2x.png?id=5503a838a78b344754e92cd116207d96 2x"}



### [Moving Features between Objects](/refactoring/techniques/moving-features-between-objects)


Even if you have distributed functionality among different classes in a
less-than-perfect way, there is still hope.

These refactoring techniques show how to safely move functionality
between classes, create new classes, and hide implementation details
from public access.

-   [Move Field](/move-field)

![](/images/refactoring/content/catalog/organizing-data.png?id=0be19b5980545dccb976d377ec731d30){width="160"
height="280"
srcset="/images/refactoring/content/catalog/organizing-data-2x.png?id=881db3197ef8ea87bd55320073462caa 2x"}



### [Organizing Data](/refactoring/techniques/organizing-data)


These refactoring techniques help with data handling, replacing
primitives with rich class functionality. Another important result is
untangling of class associations, which makes classes more portable and
reusable.

-   [Change Reference to Value](/change-reference-to-value)
-   [Duplicate Observed Data](/duplicate-observed-data)

srcset="/images/refactoring/content/catalog/simplifying-conditional-expressions-2x.png?id=a6ffc35feb77eac6108ee31655ae92d1 2x"}



### [Simplifying Conditional Expressions](/refactoring/techniques/simplifying-conditional-expressions)


Conditionals tend to get more and more complicated in their logic over
time, and there are yet more techniques to combat this as well.



-   [Consolidate Conditional
    Expression](/consolidate-conditional-expression)
-   [Consolidate Duplicate Conditional
    Fragments](/consolidate-duplicate-conditional-fragments)
-   [Decompose Conditional](/decompose-conditional)

    Clauses](/replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses)

```{=html}

srcset="/images/refactoring/content/catalog/simplifying-method-calls-2x.png?id=075a4082f9a85d01391184efa3c8f1a1 2x"}



### [Simplifying Method Calls](/refactoring/techniques/simplifying-method-calls)


These techniques make method calls simpler and easier to understand.
This, in turn, simplifies the interfaces for interaction between
classes.

-   [Remove Parameter](/remove-parameter)
-   [Rename Method](/rename-method)

-   [Replace Parameter with Explicit
    Methods](/replace-parameter-with-explicit-methods)
-   [Replace Parameter with Method
    Call](/replace-parameter-with-method-call)

```{=html}

```
-   [Hide Method](/hide-method)
-   [Replace Constructor with Factory
    Method](/replace-constructor-with-factory-method)
-   [Replace Error Code with
    Exception](/replace-error-code-with-exception)
-   [Replace Exception with Test](/replace-exception-with-test)








![](/images/refactoring/content/catalog/dealing-with-generalization.png?id=56357b115153175b2eb40563d936087c){width="160"

srcset="/images/refactoring/content/catalog/dealing-with-generalization-2x.png?id=5187a4b8d010877a25761926c2f24a3c 2x"}



### [Dealing with Generalization](/refactoring/techniques/dealing-with-generalization)


Abstraction has its own group of refactoring techniques, primarily
associated with moving functionality along the class inheritance
hierarchy, creating new classes and interfaces, and replacing
inheritance with delegation and vice versa.
